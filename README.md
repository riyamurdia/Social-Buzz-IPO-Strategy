# Social-Buzz-IPO-Strategy
Disclaimer - This is Forage Accenture Virtual Internship Project

Social Buzz, founded in 2008 by two former engineers from a leading social media company, has evolved into a platform that prioritizes content through anonymity and diverse user reactions, with over 500 million monthly active users. The platform is challenged by its rapid growth and the massive volumes of unstructured data it processes daily, including texts, images, videos, and GIFs.

With an upcoming IPO and the need for enhanced data management strategies, Social Buzz is seeking expert guidance. In this project, as a Business Analyst, I will conduct a three-month engagement focusing on auditing their big data practices, providing IPO preparation support, and analyzing the top five content categories by popularity. This effort is designed to position Social Buzz for sustainable expansion and improved operational efficiency.
